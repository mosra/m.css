`Math`_
=======

For Pelican, download the `m/math.py and latex2svg.py <{filename}/plugins.rst>`_
files, put them including the ``m/`` directory into one of your
:py:`PLUGIN_PATHS` and add :py:`m.math` package to your :py:`PLUGINS` in
``pelicanconf.py``. This plugin assumes presence of
`m.htmlsanity <{filename}/plugins/htmlsanity.rst>`_.

.. code:: python

    PLUGINS += ['m.htmlsanity', 'm.math']
    M_MATH_RENDER_AS_CODE = False
    M_MATH_CACHE_FILE = 'm.math.cache'

For the Python doc theme, it's enough to mention it in :py:`PLUGINS`. The
`m.htmlsanity`_ plugin is available always, no need to mention it explicitly:

.. code:: py

    PLUGINS += ['m.code']

For the Doxygen theme, this feature is builtin. Use either the ``@f[`` command
for block-level math or the ``@f$`` command for inline math. It's possible to
add extra CSS classes by placing ``@m_class`` in a paragraph before the actual
math block (or right before inline math), see the
`Doxygen theme-specific commands <http://localhost:8000/documentation/doxygen/#theme-specific-commands>`_
for more information. The :ini:`M_MATH_CACHE_FILE` option is supported as well;
there's no equivalent to the :ini:`M_MATH_RENDER_AS_CODE` option implemented at
this point.

In addition you need some LaTeX distribution installed. Use your distribution
package manager, for example on Ubuntu:

.. code:: sh

    sudo apt install \
        texlive-base \
        texlive-latex-extra \
        texlive-fonts-extra \
        texlive-fonts-recommended

.. block-warning:: Note for macOS users

    On macOS 10.11 and up, if you use MacTex, there's some additional setup
    needed `as detailed here <https://tex.stackexchange.com/a/249967>`_ --- you
    need to update your :sh:`$PATH` so the binaries are properly found:

    .. code:: sh

        export PATH=$PATH:/Library/TeX/Distributions/.DefaultTeX/Contents/Programs/texbin

.. note-success::

    This plugin makes use of the ``latex2svg.py`` utility from :gh:`tuxu/latex2svg`,
    © 2017 `Tino Wagner <http://www.tinowagner.com/>`_, licensed under
    :gh:`MIT <tuxu/latex2svg$master/LICENSE.md>`.

The plugin overrides the builtin docutils
`math directive <http://docutils.sourceforge.net/docs/ref/rst/directives.html#math>`_
and `math interpreted text role <http://docutils.sourceforge.net/docs/ref/rst/roles.html#math>`_
and:

-   Instead of relying on MathML or MathJax, converts input LaTeX math formula
    to a SVG file, which is then embedded directly to the page. All glyphs are
    converted to paths.
-   Size is represented using CSS :css:`em` units so the formula follows
    surrounding text size.
-   Adds a possibility to color the whole formula or parts of it using colors
    that follow the current theme.
-   Adds a :html:`<title>` containing the original formula to the generated
    :html:`<svg>` element for accessibility.

Put `math blocks <{filename}/css/components.rst#math>`_ into the :rst:`.. math::`
directive; if you want to color the equations, add corresponding
`CSS class <{filename}/css/components.rst#colors>`_ via a :rst:`:class:`
option.

.. code-figure::

    .. code:: rst

        .. math::
            :class: m-success

            \boldsymbol{A} = \begin{pmatrix}
                \frac{2n}{s_x} & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
                0 & \frac{2n}{s_y} & 0 & 0 \\
                0 & 0 & \frac{n + f}{n - f} & \frac{2nf}{n - f} \\
                0 & 0 & -1 & 0
            \end{pmatrix}

    .. math::
        :class: m-success

        \boldsymbol{A} = \begin{pmatrix}
            \frac{2n}{s_x} & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
            0 & \frac{2n}{s_y} & 0 & 0 \\
            0 & 0 & \frac{n + f}{n - f} & \frac{2nf}{n - f} \\
            0 & 0 & -1 & 0
        \end{pmatrix}

Inline math can be wrapped in the :rst:`:math:` interpreted text role. If you
want to add additional CSS classes, derive a custom role from it.

.. code-figure::

    .. code:: rst

        .. role:: math-info(math)
            :class: m-info

        Quaternion-conjugated dual quaternion is :math-info:`\hat q^* = q_0^* + q_\epsilon^*`,
        while dual-conjugation gives :math:`\overline{\hat q} = q_0 - \epsilon q_\epsilon`.

    .. role:: math-info(math)
        :class: m-info

    Quaternion-conjugated dual quaternion is :math-info:`\hat q^* = q_0^* + q_\epsilon^*`,
    while dual-conjugation gives :math:`\overline{\hat q} = q_0 - \epsilon q_\epsilon`.

The resulting SVG follows font size of surrounding text, so you can use math
even outside of main page copy:

.. code-figure::

    .. code:: rst

        .. button-success:: https://tauday.com/

            The :math:`\tau` manifesto

            they say :math:`\pi` is wrong

    .. button-success:: https://tauday.com/

        The :math:`\tau` manifesto

        they say :math:`\pi` is wrong

The ``xcolor`` package is enabled by default together with names matching CSS
color classes. You can use it to highlight different parts of the formula:

.. code-figure::

    .. code:: rst

        .. math::

            \boldsymbol{A} = \begin{pmatrix}
                {\color{m-info} s_x} & 0 & 0 & {\color{m-success} t_x} \\
                0 & {\color{m-info} s_y} & 0 & {\color{m-success} t_y} \\
                0 & 0 & {\color{m-info} s_z} & {\color{m-success} t_z} \\
                0 & 0 & 0 & 1
            \end{pmatrix}

    .. math::

        \boldsymbol{A} = \begin{pmatrix}
            {\color{m-info} s_x} & 0 & 0 & {\color{m-success} t_x} \\
            0 & {\color{m-info} s_y} & 0 & {\color{m-success} t_y} \\
            0 & 0 & {\color{m-info} s_z} & {\color{m-success} t_z} \\
            0 & 0 & 0 & 1
        \end{pmatrix}

The :py:`M_MATH_CACHE_FILE` setting (defaulting to ``m.math.cache`` in the
site root directory) describes a file used for caching rendered LaTeX math
formulas for speeding up subsequent runs. Cached output that's no longer needed
is periodically pruned and new formulas added to the file. Set it to :py:`None`
to disable caching.

.. note-info::

    LaTeX can be sometimes a real pain to set up. In order to make it possible
    to work on sites that use the :py:`m.math` plugin on machines without LaTeX
    installed, you can enable a fallback option to render all math as code
    blocks using the :py:`M_MATH_RENDER_AS_CODE` setting. That can be, for
    example, combined with a check for presence of the LaTeX binary:

    .. code:: py

        import shutil
        import logging

        if not shutil.which('latex'):
            logging.warning("LaTeX not found, fallback to rendering math as code")
            M_MATH_RENDER_AS_CODE = True

`Math figure`_
--------------

See the `m.components <{filename}/plugins/components.rst#code-math-and-graph-figure>`__
plugin for details about code figures using the :rst:`.. math-figure::`
directive.

.. code-figure::

    .. code:: rst

        .. math-figure:: Infinite projection matrix

            .. math::
                :class: m-success

                \boldsymbol{A} = \begin{pmatrix}
                    \frac{2n}{s_x} & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
                    0 & \frac{2n}{s_y} & 0 & 0 \\
                    0 & 0 & -1 & -2n \\
                    0 & 0 & -1 & 0
                \end{pmatrix}

            With :math:`f = \infty`.

    .. math-figure:: Infinite projection matrix

        .. math::
            :class: m-success

            \boldsymbol{A} = \begin{pmatrix}
                \frac{2n}{s_x} & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
                0 & \frac{2n}{s_y} & 0 & 0 \\
                0 & 0 & -1 & -2n \\
                0 & 0 & -1 & 0
            \end{pmatrix}

        .. class:: m-noindent

        With :math:`f = \infty`.

`Code`_
=======

For Pelican, download the `m/code.py and ansilexer.py <{filename}/plugins.rst>`_
files, put them including the ``m/`` directory into one of your :py:`PLUGIN_PATHS`
and add :py:`m.code` package to your :py:`PLUGINS` in ``pelicanconf.py``. This
plugin assumes presence of `m.htmlsanity <{filename}/plugins/htmlsanity.rst>`_.

.. code:: python

    PLUGINS += ['m-htmlsanity', 'm.code']
    M_CODE_FILTERS_PRE = []
    M_CODE_FILTERS_POST = []

For the Python doc theme, it's enough to mention it in :py:`PLUGINS`. The
`m.htmlsanity`_ plugin is available always, no need to mention it explicitly:

.. code:: py

    PLUGINS += ['m.code']

For the Doxygen theme, this feature is builtin. Use the ``@code{.ext}`` command
either in a block or inline, the various ``@include`` and ``@snippet`` commands
support it as well. Language detection is done from the value of ``.ext`` in
the ``@code`` command and from the include/snippet filename for the others.
It's possible to add extra CSS classes by placing ``@m_class`` in a paragraph
before the actual code block (or right before inline code), see the
`Doxygen theme-specific commands <http://localhost:8000/documentation/doxygen/#theme-specific-commands>`_
for more information. There's no possibility to highlight particular code
lines.

In addition you need to have `Pygments <http://pygments.org>`_ installed. Get
it via ``pip`` or your distribution package manager:

.. code:: sh

    pip3 install Pygments

The plugin overrides the builtin docutils
`code directive <http://docutils.sourceforge.net/docs/ref/rst/directives.html#code>`_
and `code interpreted text role <http://docutils.sourceforge.net/docs/ref/rst/roles.html#code>`_,
replaces `Pelican code-block directive <https://docs.getpelican.com/en/stable/content.html#syntax-highlighting>`_ and:

-   Wraps Pygments output in :html:`<code>` element for inline code and
    :html:`<pre>` element for code blocks with :css:`.m-code` CSS class
    applied.
-   Removes useless CSS classes from the output.
-   Adds a :rst:`:filters:` option. See `Filters`_ below.

Put `code blocks <{filename}/css/components.rst#code>`_ into the :rst:`.. code::`
directive and specify the language via a parameter. Use :rst:`:hl_lines:`
option to highlight lines; if you want to add additional CSS classes, use the
:rst:`:class:` option.

.. code-figure::

    .. code:: rst

        .. code:: c++
            :hl_lines: 4 5
            :class: m-inverted

            #include <iostream>

            int main() {
                std::cout << "Hello world!" << std::endl;
                return 0;
            }

    .. code:: c++
        :hl_lines: 4 5
        :class: m-inverted

        #include <iostream>

        int main() {
            std::cout << "Hello world!" << std::endl;
            return 0;
        }

The `builtin include directive <http://docutils.sourceforge.net/docs/ref/rst/directives.html#include>`_
is also patched to use the improved code directive, and:

-   Drops the rarely useful :rst:`:encoding:`, :rst:`:literal:` and
    :rst:`:name:` options
-   Adds a :rst:`:start-on:` and :rst:`:strip-prefix:` options, and improves
    :rst:`:end-before:`. See `Advanced file inclusion`_ below.

Simply specify external code snippets filename and set the language using the
:rst:`:code:` option. All options of the :rst:`.. code::` directive are
supported as well.

.. code-figure::

    .. code:: rst

        .. include:: snippet.cpp
            :code: c++
            :start-line: 2

    .. include:: math-and-code-snippet.cpp
        :code: c++
        :start-line: 2

.. note-info::

    Note that the :rst:`.. include::` directives are processed before Pelican
    comes into play, and thus no special internal linking capabilities are
    supported. In particular, relative paths are assumed to be relative to path
    of the source file.

For inline code highlighting, use :rst:`:code:` interpreted text role. To
specify which language should be highlighted, derive a custom role from it:

.. code-figure::

    .. code:: rst

        .. role:: cmake(code)
            :language: cmake

        .. role:: cpp(code)
            :language: cpp

        With the :cmake:`add_executable(foo bar.cpp)` CMake command you can create an
        executable from a file that contains just :cpp:`int main() { return 666; }` and
        nothing else.

    .. role:: cmake(code)
        :language: cmake

    .. role:: cpp(code)
        :language: cpp

    With the :cmake:`add_executable(foo bar.cpp)` CMake command you can create
    an executable from a file that contains just :cpp:`int main() { return 666; }`
    and nothing else.

`Colored terminal output`_
--------------------------

Use the ``ansi`` pseudo-language for highlighting
`colored terminal output <{filename}/css/components.rst#colored-terminal-output>`_.
The plugin will take care of the rest like using the custom Pygments lexer and
assigning a proper CSS class. Because ANSI escape codes might cause problems
with some editors and look confusing when viewed via :sh:`git diff` on the
terminal, it's best to have the listings in external files and use
:rst:`.. include::`:

.. code-figure::

    .. code:: rst

        .. include:: console.ansi
            :code: ansi

    .. include:: math-and-code-console.ansi
        :code: ansi
        :class: m-nopad

There's support for the basic foreground and background color sets, 256 palette
colors using the ``\033[38;5;{p}m`` or ``\033[48;5;{p}m`` color sequences,
and 24bit colors using the ``\033[38;2;{r};{g};{b}m`` and
``\033[48;2;{r};{g};{b}m`` color sequences. The non-bright basic foreground
colors can be independently brightened using the ``\033[1m`` color sequence:

.. include:: math-and-code-console-colors.ansi
    :code: ansi

`Code figure`_
--------------

See the `m.components <{filename}/plugins/components.rst#code-math-and-graph-figure>`__
plugin for details about code figures using the :rst:`.. code-figure::`
directive.

`Advanced file inclusion`_
--------------------------

Compared to the `builtin include directive`_, the m.css-patched variant
additionally provides a :rst:`:strip-prefix:` option that strips a prefix from
each included line. This can be used for example to remove excessive
indentation from code blocks. To avoid trailing whitespace, you can wrap the
value in quotes. Reusing the snippet from above, showing only the code inside
:cpp:`main()`:

.. code-figure::

    .. code:: rst

        .. include:: snippet.cpp
            :code: c++
            :start-line: 3
            :end-line: 5
            :strip-prefix: '    '

    .. include:: math-and-code-snippet.cpp
        :code: c++
        :start-line: 3
        :end-line: 5
        :strip-prefix: '    '

This isn't limited to just whitespace though --- since the :rst:`.. include::`
directive works for including reStructuredText as well, it can be used to embed
parts of self-contained python scripts on the page. Consider this file,
``two-sins.py``:

.. include:: math-and-code-selfcontained.py
    :code: py

Embedding it on a page, mixed together with other content (and unimportant
parts omitted), can look like below. The :rst:`:start-on:` option can be used
to pin to a particular line (instead of skipping it like :rst:`:start-after:`
does) and an empty :rst:`:end-before:` will include everything until the next
blank line. Finally, :rst:`:strip-prefix:` strips the leading :py:`#` from the
comments embedded in Python code:

.. code-figure::

    .. code:: rst

        .. include:: two-sins.py
            :start-after: """
            :end-before: """

        .. code-figure::

            .. include:: two-sins.py
                :start-on: sin =
                :end-before:
                :code: py

            0.13545234412104434

        .. include:: two-sins.py
            :start-on: # And a sum with itself
            :strip-prefix: '# '
            :end-before:

        .. include:: two-sins.py
            :start-on: two_sins
            :code: py

    .. include:: math-and-code-selfcontained.py
        :start-after: """
        :end-before: """

    .. code-figure::

        .. include:: math-and-code-selfcontained.py
            :start-on: sin =
            :end-before:
            :code: py

        0.13545234412104434

    .. include:: math-and-code-selfcontained.py
        :start-on: # And a sum with itself
        :strip-prefix: '# '
        :end-before:

    .. include:: math-and-code-selfcontained.py
        :start-on: two_sins
        :code: py

`Filters`_
----------

It's possible to supply filters that get applied both before and after a
code snippet is rendered using the :py:`M_CODE_FILTERS_PRE` and
:py:`M_CODE_FILTERS_POST` options. It's a dict with keys being the lexer
name [1]_ and values being filter functions. Each function that gets string as
an input and is expected to return a modified string. In the following example,
all CSS code snippets have the hexadecimal color literals annotated with a
`color swatch <{filename}/css/components.rst#color-swatches-in-code-snippets>`_:

.. code:: py
    :class: m-console-wrap

    import re

    _css_colors_src = re.compile(r"""<span class="mh">#(?P<hex>[0-9a-f]{6})</span>""")
    _css_colors_dst = r"""<span class="mh">#\g<hex><span class="m-code-color" style="background-color: #\g<hex>;"></span></span>"""

    M_CODE_FILTERS_POST = {
        'CSS': lambda code: _css_colors_src.sub(_css_colors_dst, code)
    }

.. code-figure::

    .. code:: rst

        .. code:: css

            p.green {
              color: #3bd267;
            }

    .. code:: css

        p.green {
          color: #3bd267;
        }

In the above case, the filter gets applied globally to all code snippets of
given language. Sometimes it might be desirable to apply a filter only to
specific code snippet --- in that case, the dict key is a tuple of
:py:`(lexer, filter)` where the second item is a filter name. This filter name
is then referenced from the :rst:`:filters:` option of the :rst:`.. code::` and
:rst:`.. include::` directives as well as the inline :rst:`:code:` text role.
Multiple filters can be specified when separated by spaces.

.. code:: py

    M_CODE_FILTERS_PRE = {
        ('C++', 'codename'): lambda code: code.replace('DirtyMess', 'P300::V1'),
        ('C++', 'fix_typography'): lambda code: code.replace(' :', ':'),
    }

.. code-figure::

    .. code:: rst

        .. code:: cpp
            :filters: codename fix_typography

            for(auto& a : DirtyMess::managedEntities()) {
                // ...
            }

    .. code:: cpp
        :filters: codename fix_typography

        for(auto& a : DirtyMess::managedEntities()) {
            // ...
        }

.. [1] In order to have an unique mapping, the filters can't use the aliases
    --- for example C++ code can be highlighted using either ``c++`` or ``cpp``
    as a language name and the dict would need to have an entry for each. An unique lexer name is the :py:`name` field used in the particular lexer
    source, you can also see the names in the language dropdown on the
    `official website <http://pygments.org/demo/>`_.
