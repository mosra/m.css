Doc generators
##############

m.css is not just for static sites and blogs --- there's a need for a modern,
lightweight and mobile-friendly layout for API documentation as well. The m.css
documentation generators are defined by their first-class search functionality
and clutter-free output, favoring human-produced documentation over
autogenerated content.

`Features`_
===========

All m.css documentation themes share the following features:

-   Modern, lightweight and mobile-friendly HTML5 markup
-   Minimalistic design without unnecessary chrome and UI elements
-   Focused on presenting the actual written documentation while reducing
    questionable auto-generated content
-   Math rendered as embedded SVG instead of raster images / MathJax, making
    use of the `m.math <{filename}/plugins/math-and-code.rst#math>`_ plugin
-   Graphviz / Dot diagrams rendered as embedded SVG, as implemented in
    `m.dot <{filename}/plugins/plots-and-graphs.rst#graphs>`_
-   Using Pygments for better code highlighting, courtesy of the
    `m.code <{filename}/plugins/math-and-code.rst#code>`_ plugin

`Search`_
---------

-   Vastly superior search capabilities with immediate feedback
-   Search anywhere from a page by opening a popup using a hotkey
-   Lookahead with instant feedback without requiring any server-side backend
-   Search for symbols using any prefix
-   Fully controllable by keyboard

.. note-success::

    If you want to know more, the search functionality implementation and
    features are detailed
    `in this blog post <https://blog.magnum.graphics/meta/implementing-a-fast-doxygen-search/>`_.

`Doxygen C++ theme » <{filename}/documentation/doxygen.rst>`_
=============================================================

More than just a theme --- taking the XML output produced by Doxygen, cleaning
it up, reducing the autogenerated clutter, while making it mobile-friendly and
extending it with better content layouting capabilities and improved support
for C++11 and beyond. Fully compatible with Doxygen URL format and tag files to
avoid broken links once you switch.

`Python docs » <{filename}/documentation/python.rst>`_
======================================================

All features you're used to from either the m.css Pelican theme or the Doxygen
C++ theme, only for Python documentation. Extracting Python APIs using
reflection, *not* parsing Python sources itself. With dedicated support for
pybind11 projects.
