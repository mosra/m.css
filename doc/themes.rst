Themes
######

On top of the low-level CSS styles, m.css provides ready-made themes suited
mainly for static site generators and other tools powered by
`reStructuredText <http://docutils.sourceforge.net/rst.html>`_.

.. note-warning::

    Please, in this case, don't judge the book by its cover --- the
    :abbr:`reST <reStructuredText>` website might look like it was made in 1992
    and never updated since, but believe me, it's a remarkably designed format.
    Once you dive into it, you will not want to go back to Markdown.
