Do you *hate* contemporary web development like I do? Do you also feel that
it's not right for a web page to take *seconds* and *megabytes* to render? Do
you want to write beautiful content but *can't* because the usual CMS tools
make your blood boil and so you rather stay silent? Well, I have something for
you.

Project website: http://mcss.mosra.cz

Pure CSS and HTML
=================

Everything you need is a few kilobytes of compressed CSS. This framework has
exactly 0 bytes of JavaScript because *nobody actually needs it*. Even for
responsive websites.

Designed for content
====================

If you just want to write content with beautiful typography, you don't need
forms, progressbars, popups, dropdowns or other shit. You want fast iteration
times.

`Use it with Pelican <http://mcss.mosra.cz/pelican/>`_

Authoring made easy
===================

Code snippets, math, linking to docs, presenting photography in a beautiful
way? Or making a complex page without even needing to touch HTML? Everything is
possible.
